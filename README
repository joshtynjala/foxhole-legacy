Foxhole UI controls for Adobe AIR mobile development. They're all designed with Adobe AIR's gpu renderMode in mind. Recommended for AIR 2.7 or newer across all platforms.

These controls extend fl.core.UIComponent, which Adobe includes with Flash Professional. I made this decision mostly for convenience because I wanted to avoid rewriting invalidation, the style system, and other stuff like that.

The following components are currently available:

Button
A typical button control with up, down, and disabled states (no over on mobile)

ToggleButton
Adds selected states to Button. May be combined with ToggleGroup for things like a tab bar or a radio group.

ToggleSwitch
A sliding on/off switch, similar to what's available on iOS.

Slider
A typical horizontal or vertical slider control.

TouchList
A touch-based, vertical list control. Has elastic edges and you can "fling" it.

TouchScroller
Similar to the list, but it may hold arbitary content and scroll in either direction.

Enjoy!
