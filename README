Foxhole UI controls for Adobe AIR mobile development, created by Josh Tynjala. I'm building and extending these controls as I need them for my mobile projects, which are mostly games. Documentation is sparse. I may completely change APIs on a whim. They're not necessarily fully featured. Use at your own risk.

Expected to be used with AIR 2.7 or newer. Best performance using "<renderMode>gpu</renderMode>" with Bitmap skins. CAB and CABM are not required as Bitmap has been heavily optimized in recent versions of AIR.

These controls extend fl.core.UIComponent, which Adobe includes with Flash Professional. I made this decision mostly for convenience because I wanted to avoid rewriting invalidation, the style system, and other stuff like that. This choice is subject to change because there are a lot of things I don't like about the fl.* components.

The following components are currently available:

Button
A typical button control with up, down, and disabled states (no over on mobile)

ToggleButton
Adds selected states to Button. May be combined with ToggleGroup for things like a tab bar or a radio group.

ToggleSwitch
A sliding on/off switch, similar to what's available on iOS.

Slider
A typical horizontal or vertical slider control.

TouchList
A touch-based, vertical list control. Has elastic edges and you can "fling" it.

PickerList
A control like a combo box. The list appears as a fullscreen overlay on top of the stage.

TouchScroller
Similar to the list, but it may hold arbitary content and scroll in either direction.

Enjoy!
