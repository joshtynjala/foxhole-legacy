Foxhole UI controls for mobile Flash development. Optimized for Adobe's Packager for iPhone.

They’re based on fl.core.UIComponent, mostly for convenience so that I didn’t have to rewrite the style system and stuff. The code is probably not well documented, and there are only a few components based on what I actually needed:

Button
ToggleButton (I used this one to make a primitive TabBar... see also: ToggleGroup)
Switch (on/off)
TouchList

They all assume that renderMode is gpu. Everything performs well, even on the original iPhone.

A couple tips for TouchList:

1) Make sure your CellRenderer sets cacheAsBitmap on itself or its children. The list doesn’t do it automatically because complex renderers might be able to optimize their own content better.

2) There’s a property to clip the TouchList content, but for best performance, cover up the edges with other chrome instead.
