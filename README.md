# Foxhole (Legacy)

Foxhole UI components for use with the classic display list and GPU render mode. This is the original version of Foxhole that was introduced before Stage 3D was available. This project is considered **deprecated** because Starling performance is now better than GPU render mode, and it's not worth the effort to maintain both in parallel anymore.

For continued development, see [Feathers](https://github.com/joshtynjala/feathers).
